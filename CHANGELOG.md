# Changelog

Versioning note:
- public release numbering starts at `1.x`
- the March 5 rewrite was previously tracked internally as `2.0.0`
- install commands use the bare repo path (no version tag)

## [1.2.6] - 2026-03-17

OpenClaw same-chat queueing and queued-run delivery hardening.

### Fixed

- `openclaw-plugin/index-lib.mjs` — registers `/trade` runs into a per-chat worker lane before handoff so later requests in the same chat queue instead of racing
- `openclaw-plugin/run-trade-wrapper-lib.mjs` — reuses one hidden worker session per chat burst, rotates to a fresh lane after the queue drains, cleans up lane state when wrapper children exit, keeps live-link waiting aligned with queued execution, and bounds final-message lookup so queued completions still deliver
- `openclaw-plugin/trade-slash-dispatch-lib.mjs` — returns queued acknowledgement text when a same-chat `/trade` is already ahead in line

### Changed

- OpenClaw chat flow now supports deterministic FIFO behavior within one chat: immediate run or queued ack -> progress link when that run starts -> compact final summary, including queued runs that begin later

## [1.2.5] - 2026-03-15

Breaking news chain trading.

### Changed

- `references/fast.md` — "Think in chains": route 2nd and 3rd order effects when the causal chain is clear, not just the direct trade. Removes prescriptive steps, higher abstraction.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-13

Shared chat contract rollback after wrapper overreach.

### Fixed

- `SKILL.md` — removes wrapper-era chat suppression from the shared skill body; direct clients can be thoughtful again instead of being forced into a cold scoreboard-style final reply
- `SKILL.md` — drops the "source page is the primary interface", fixed 3-message cap, and "keep all reasoning off chat" rules from the common prompt
- `SKILL.md` — keeps only the durable cross-runtime contract: send the live link immediately, continue the run after the link, and never batch delayed progress into one dump at the end

### Changed

- Direct `/trade` runs in Claude Code, Codex, and terminal should feel closer to the pre-wrapper behavior again: fast live link, then normal reasoning and final explanation
- OpenClaw still uses the wrapper for delivery control, but the base skill no longer teaches every runtime to be terse and silent

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-13

Prompt-boundary cleanup for direct clients and the OpenClaw wrapper.

### Fixed

- `SKILL.md` — removes OpenClaw-specific branching from the shared skill body; the common contract is now client-agnostic: send the live link immediately unless the runtime handles it, then keep going in the same run
- `openclaw-plugin/trade-slash-dispatch-lib.mjs` — trims the wrapper overlay down to true delivery overrides instead of re-explaining the whole pipeline
- `references/index/skill-index.md` and `references/index/skill-ascii.md` — summary docs now reflect the runtime-agnostic continuation rule

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-13

Direct-client continuation fix after source creation.

### Fixed

- `SKILL.md` — direct clients now send the `Watch live` link and continue the same `/trade` run instead of stopping at source creation
- `references/index/skill-index.md` and `references/index/skill-ascii.md` — summary docs now match the continuation rule instead of the old stop-after-link behavior

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-13

OpenClaw wrapper reliability and chat UX fixes.

### Fixed

- `openclaw-plugin/run-trade-wrapper-lib.mjs` — runs `/trade` in a fresh per-run session, sends the progress link directly after source creation, waits for real runtime evidence before marking the run complete, and forwards only the compact final summary back to chat
- `openclaw-plugin/run-trade-wrapper.mjs` — awaits the async wrapper exit path so the live-link watcher does not crash before sending the progress link
- `openclaw-plugin/trade-slash-dispatch-lib.mjs` — resolves installed-vs-dev skill layouts correctly and injects wrapper-specific system instructions so the worker stays silent until final summary
- `SKILL.md` — fixes public-repo path examples from `skill/scripts/...` to `scripts/...` and from `skill/references/...` to `references/...`

### Changed

- OpenClaw chat flow is now: immediate background acknowledgement -> progress link -> final summary
- OpenClaw wrapper runs no longer spill intermediate model chatter like routing or posting updates into the main chat
- OpenClaw install docs now reflect automatic gateway reload after wrapper setup

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Removed

- `scripts/assess.ts` — stale alias (use `route.ts`)
- `scripts/route-check.ts` — stale alias (use `route.ts`)
- `references/glossary.md` — removed from dev

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

Full sync from canonical dev repo. Three days of improvements since launch.

### Changed

- Core loop restructured: new step 3 (Enrich) for metadata resolution, speaker identity, diarization
- Step 5 split into sub-steps: 5a Research, 5b Narrate, 5c Price and save
- Derivation now includes `explanation` (free-form prose) and `comparison` (candidate grid) alongside steps
- Explanation voice guidance: lead with sharp insight, hedge with data not qualifiers
- `route-check.ts` replaced by `route.ts` as primary routing adapter (route-check kept as alias)
- `entry_price` renamed to `publish_price` across all schemas
- `headline` renamed to `headline_quote` with frozen-at-extraction semantics
- Save/post validation errors now exit 0 with `{ok: false}` (parallel-safe, no sibling-call cancellation)
- Sequential post constraint removed — posts can run concurrently
- `batch-save.ts` promoted to preferred save method for multi-thesis sources
- Save --update merged into single call (who + route_evidence + derivation together)
- Route evidence cross-reference validation documented
- `route.ts` output envelope documented (tool/route/diagnostics wrapper)
- Reference file pointer added to SKILL.md header

- "Out of scope" items now all in scope (edit-mode, prediction-market routing)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-05

First public release contract. Renumbered from the internal prelaunch `2.0.0`
rewrite from `v2-lab`.

### Changed

- Skill prompt rewritten with think-out-loud narration style
- Routing sequence is now: web research -> instrument discovery -> route-check -> save
- Web research is mandatory before picking instruments (training data is stale)
- Thesis scope determines routing: sector theses route to sector instruments, single stocks are proxies
- Diarization is now default-off, only triggered when attribution quality is insufficient
- Long transcript parallelization gated to word_count > 8,000 or chars > 45,000
- Headline target 120 chars, hard-fail at 180 chars
- `who` field now array-of-objects with 1-3 plausible instruments before route-check
- Reply format: Block 1 (why) + Block 2 (how to execute) with portfolio map for 3+ trades
- Post hydration derives missing fields from saved extraction, backfills via /api/skill/assess
- Chat UX has sequenced status messages: expectation -> duration -> live link -> summary
- Route evidence includes entry_price, source_date_price, since_published_move_pct

### Restructured

- Flat `scripts/` directory replaces nested `skill/adapters/` hierarchy
- `adapters/hyperliquid/` retained for instrument discovery only
- `references/` directory for supplementary docs
- Removed yahoo-finance2 dependency (market data served via paste.trade API)

### Out of scope (rollback profile)

- Edit-mode maintenance flows
- X profile scan workflows
- Prediction-market routing adapters

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Public `/trade` runtime adapters required for extract -> route -> post -> finalize flow.
- OpenClaw slash wrapper plugin (`trade-slash-wrapper`) and setup script.
- Public install/update docs for OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Codex.
- Public governance docs: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Excluded by design

- Web app, worker app, archived/internal references, local memory/data snapshots.
