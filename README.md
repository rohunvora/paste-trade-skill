# paste-trade-skill

This is a skill for your AI agent. It adds the `/trade` command.

Finds every tradeable thesis in a source and routes each to an executable trade on [paste.trade](https://paste.trade). Works with tweets, podcasts, articles, screenshots, hunches, and market observations.

## Supported clients

- Claude Code
- OpenClaw
- Codex

## Install

Claude Code and Codex only need the `trade` skill itself.

OpenClaw needs one extra OpenClaw-only component: an async command bridge that
acknowledges `/trade` immediately, queues same-chat requests in a private
background worker lane, sends a progress link as soon as the source is
created for that run, returns a compact final summary when it finishes, and
keeps intermediate worker chatter out of your main chat. If you are not using
OpenClaw, ignore that step completely.

### Claude Code / Codex

Paste the repo URL into your agent:

```
https://github.com/rohunvora/paste-trade-skill
```

### OpenClaw

Paste the repo URL into your agent:

```
https://github.com/rohunvora/paste-trade-skill
```

Then run the wrapper setup from the installed skill directory:

```bash
bash <skill-install-path>/scripts/setup-openclaw-wrapper.sh
```

The agent knows where it installed the skill — use that path.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- `yt-dlp` for YouTube extraction — the skill will offer to install it on first run
- See [env.example](env.example) for all environment variables (required and optional)

## Use cases

YouTube (podcasts, long videos, interviews):
```text
/trade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<video_id>
```

Twitter/X (tweets):
```text
/trade https://x.com/<handle>/status/<tweet_id>
```

Articles and PDFs:
```text
/trade https://example.com/research-note
```

Screenshots:
```text
/trade [attach screenshot] route every tradeable thesis in this image
```

Direct thesis (raw market observation):
```text
/trade NVDA is down 25% and Blackwell demand is unchanged. route the cleanest expression.
```

## Update

### Claude Code / Codex

Paste the repo URL into your agent again:

```
https://github.com/rohunvora/paste-trade-skill
```

### OpenClaw

Paste the repo URL into your agent again:

```
https://github.com/rohunvora/paste-trade-skill
```

Then rerun wrapper setup from the installed skill directory:

```bash
bash <skill-install-path>/scripts/setup-openclaw-wrapper.sh
```

## Account portability

- Preferred path: use one `PASTE_TRADE_KEY` across OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Codex.
- Fallback for users who already created separate keys: run `bun run scripts/connect.ts` from the account you want to keep.
- X login is optional. It should not block first `/trade` run.
