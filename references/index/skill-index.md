# SKILL.md Reference Index

Every rule gets an ID: section number + letter. Say "change 8g" not "the step count rule in narrate."

`Flow` column:

- `in:` upstream input, producer, or prior rule this depends on
- `out:` downstream field, file, or later rule this feeds

`File` column — where the rule text lives:

- *(blank)* — SKILL.md (main file)
- `dense.md` — `references/dense.md` (dense source enrichment + extraction)
- `sparse.md` — `references/sparse.md` (sparse source reasoning tree, §6-§9)

Core data objects:

- `extract output` = metadata + `saved_to` from `extract.ts`
- `source run` = `source_id`, `source_url`, `run_id`
- `enriched metadata` = `author_handle`, `source_date`, `title`, `speakers`, `thumbnail_url`
- `canonical transcript` = chosen `saved_to` file path
- `thesis record` = saved thesis JSON + `thesis_id`
- `route package` = final `who` + `route_evidence` + `derivation`
- `post payload` = trade fields sent to `post.ts`
- `finalize payload` = `source_id` + `source_theses` + `source_summary` + `message`
